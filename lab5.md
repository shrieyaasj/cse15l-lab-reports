1. Hi i'm having trouble obtaining the right output for my factorial program. PFA below my screenshot for errors

PART 2 <br>
I thought designing our own autograder was super interesting since I now have a base-level understanding of what happens when I submit assignments. Especially when it came to using bash scripts to navigate through the directory and outputs to then print error/success messages.
